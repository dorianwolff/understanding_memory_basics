# **Understanding Memory Basics**

## **Why**

This project was made to review the basics of structures, using linked lists and matrices, for my exam.

It was fun and helpful.

## **How can this help**

It was a fun exercise creating a base for a game (be free to change the zqsd settings to anything you'd like).

I feel like this project can easily be expanded upon and some ideas of what you might want to add may include :

- movement for monsters
- more items
- effects to items
- a smoother display of the grid and characters
- colour codes

## **commands :**

- **make :**
  creates an executable 'game' file

- **make clean :**
  removes the executable and object files
